## Resource Allocation

In cloud computing, Resource allocation is the process of assigning available resources to the needed cloud applications.

Process of moving a running  virtual machine or application between different physical machines without disconnecting the client or application : LIVE MIGRATION

## Basic Idea:
we present a system that uses virtualization technology to allocate data center resources dynamically based on application demands and support: “Overload Avoidance” &  “Green computing” by optimizing the number of servers in use.


“How can a cloud service provider best multiplex its virtual resources onto the physical hardware?? ”
